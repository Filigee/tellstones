# Tellstones Game
This is a version of a boardgame I like to play called Tellstones.

**Link to project:** https://filigee.github.io/tellstones_game/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I made this game using html, css and vanilla javascript. It utilises drag and drop events in javascript for the main functionality.

## Lessons Learned:

I expanded my knowledge on different techniques for DOM manipulation and how to take an idea and convert it into a working piece of software

## Things I'd Change:

I think I could work on the UI and create some better styling.
